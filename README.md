# RBAC_Dashboard

A simple dashboard that shows different content based on who is logged in. 

How it works?
3 Types of Users:
Viewer - Can only see dashboard (like a regular user)
Editor - Can manage content (like a blogger)
Admin - Can manage users (like a website owner)
What happens when you use it:
You start as a Viewer - See basic dashboard
Want to test other roles? - Use dropdown in header to switch
Each role sees different pages - No real login needed, just for demo
