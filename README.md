# RBAC Dashboard

 This is a simple dashboard that shows different content based on who is logged in.

 How it works:
 1. There are three types of users:
  * Viewer – Can only see the dashboard (like a regular user).
  * Editor – Can manage content (like a blogger).
  * Admin – Can manage users (like a website owner).
 2. What happens when you use it:
 You start as a viewer and can see the basic dashboard.
 If you want to test the other roles, you can use the dropdown in the header to switch.
 Each role will see a different page. There is no actual login required, so this is just a demo.
